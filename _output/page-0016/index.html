<h1>Coding and Technologies Blog</h1>

<h2 class="post__title"><a href="/so-im-blogging-again/">So, I'm Blogging Again</a></h2>21st April 2018 - Saturday<h2>So, I'm Blogging Again</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm back in the saddle again<br>
Out where a friend is a friend</p>
<p><cite>Gene Autry &amp; Ray Whitley, 1939</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<figcaption>*Am I the cowboy or the horse?*</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">Inspired by the consistent efforts of [some](https://steemit.com/@webgrrrl) [friends](https://steemit.com/@danieldoughty) and [an article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf) at freeCodeCamp’s blog, I decided to start blogging again.
</div><div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">I’ve been using GitHub to organize most of my recent efforts and I figured that blogging with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosting for free with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) would be an ideal solution. All I need to do is create a new project named *blog*, enable GitHub Pages, and start writing [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) files. No PHP, no server, no database, no security or plugin updates… perfect, right?
<p>It’s not that easy…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We highly recommend installing Jekyll to preview your site and help troubleshoot failed Jekyll builds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They repeat this throughout <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">GitHub’s documentation</a> and they really mean it. There’s no easy way to set up a Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages without either setting up Jekyll locally or forking an existing Jekyll blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jekyll is not officially supported for Windows. For more information, see “<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation">Jekyll on Windows</a>” in the official Jekyll documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know, I know… I shouldn’t be using Windows. I used to be a devoted Linux user and I called myself an Open Source Software enthusiast. Well, I forgot. It’s a thing I’m not going to get into right now, but when I started to think again the computer in front of me had Windows on it. This is currently my only option.</p>
<p>I did the reading. This setup requires Jekyll on Ruby on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows and every step of the process comes with vague warnings about <em>issues</em>. Even if I manage to bypass any issues, I have to set up and maintain Ruby on Windows, learn how to use the Gem package manager, setup and maintain Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, learn YAML, and learn the Liquid Templating Engine.</p>
<p>Enough is enough! Damn GitHub Pages and Damn Jekyll! What happened to just writing my thoughts in markdown?! I’m busy learning more important things right now. I’m just about ready to throw in the towel and become dependent on WordPress again. One last try… I’ll look for a tutorial.</p>
<p>I found what I needed; An excellent article at Smashing Magazine entitled “<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages</a>” promises to tell me exactly how to set up my own blog with Jekyll and host it with GitHub Pages. That sounds perfect! It is just a little bit misleading, though. The article doesn’t actually tell me how to set up my own blog. It tells me how to fork the author’s blog boilerplate and change some variables to show my information instead of his.</p>
<p>You know what… I don’t care. It got the job done and now I have a Jekyll-driven blog. For now, I can post my thoughts and share them however I want to. When I decide to <em>upgrade</em>, either by learning and building Jekyll locally or by diving back into the WordPress ecosystem, I’ll have very little difficulty. My markdown files can very easily be copied over or imported into any system I choose.</p>

<h2 class="post__title"><a href="/the-asshole-response/">The Asshole Response</a></h2>27th February 2014 - Thursday<h2>The Asshole Response</h2>
<p>I subscribe / follow / participate in a lot of technology focused forums and groups throughout the World Wide Web. It is my feeling that they should be good places to make friends and ask questions of people who have similar interests and knowledge to share.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I see a disappointing number of unfriendly responses that I tend to think of as the “Asshole Response”. These responses are usually very short and often make use of acronyms like RTFM and reference URLs like lmgtfy. Sometimes they aren’t responses at all, but just links to some third-party site without any explanation.</p>
<p>Now, I acknowledge that the stated policy of many groups is that questions must be well-researched, but I think that this is a mistake. By their nature, forums and groups, especially on sites like Facebook, are a waste of time for most of the participants. So, the argument that a poorly researched question is a waste of time holds no weight.</p>
<p>There’s more to a community than just questions and answers. It would be better to encourage people to ask first when they’re having a problem. When that fails, use a search engine, and if the search engine fails, use a medium that is curated and intentionally focused on questions and answers such as StackOverflow.</p>
<p>For the record, I’m saying that anyone who leaves a response of RTFM or something similar is an asshole and is degrading the value of the community. If you’re too busy to answer the questions of people who know less than you, that’s fine… Do what you need to do and don’t waste your time in online communities.</p>
<p>I might tell people that their question is outside of the scope of the community’s focus; or refer to a better source of information, like documentation; but I won’t leave an <em>Asshole Response</em>.</p>
