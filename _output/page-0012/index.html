<h2 class="post__title"><a href="/wordpress-where-to-host-at-first/">WordPress: Where to host, at first...</a></h2>27th February 2019 - Wednesday<h2>WordPress: Where to host, at first...</h2>
<p>I recently spent some time researching and testing free WordPress hosting services. My goal was to find information for people who have never had a website before. I’ve used <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost</a> before, but I hadn’t checked out any other options in many years. I figured it was time to do a little comparison shopping. From this experience, I drew some interesting conclusions.</p>
<div style="background-color: beige; padding: 1rem 1rem 1px 1rem; box-shadow: 0 0.25rem 0.25rem 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">## tl;dr
<ul>
<li>Day 1: <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a></li>
<li>2 weeks: <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost</a></li>
<li>3 months: Paid hosting with a well-researched, reliable privider that provides the right features for your</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>I expected 000webhost to be worse…</h2>
<p>The first time I used 000webhost was probably close to 10 years ago. I haven’t checked any other options for free PHP hosting in years. In that time, a lot has changed on the web and I expected a competitor to stand out by offering better features. Instead, I discovered that other hosts typically provide an antiquated <a href="https://www.aggrippino.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cpanel_lantern.svg">cPanel management interface</a> that feels slow and sluggish by comparison to today’s responsive single page applications. 000webhost has an easy to use interface that works and responds well.</p>
<h2>I expected WordPress.com to be better…</h2>
<p>WordPress.com should be the prime example of Automattic demonstrating their flagship product at its best. Instead, they’re presenting WordPress as if it was a Freemium commercial product instead of Open Source Software. With limitations on themes, no plugins, no direct monetization, a significantly altered administration interface, and too little information about their hosting service they do little to create a positive impression of either WordPress, the software, or WordPress.com as a hosting provider.</p>
<p>However, WordPress.com still offers the quickest and easiest path to a WordPress-powered site. Create an account then choose a subdomain name and your site is ready for you to use. If you’ve never had a website before, this is the best way.</p>
<h2>Then what?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, this information is only for absolute beginners. If you’re serious about your website, you need paid hosting with a reliability guarantee and a support team. Define the needs of your site’s business model and target audience. Then you need to do research. There are many different types of hosting and thousands of competing hosts, all offering different services. You’ll need to consider page loading speed, storage space, server reliability, and many other factors. You can’t choose easily without some education and experience.</p>
<h2 class="post__title"><a href="/losing-momentum/">Losing Momentum</a></h2>30th April 2018 - Monday<h2>Losing Momentum</h2>
<p>I’m losing my momentum. That <em>new project</em> enthusiasm is gone and I’m faced with distraction and doubt. What do I do? Choose an easier alternative? Prepare more before continuing? Or push forward at a unique and considerable risk?</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">The greatest barrier to my employment right now is the lack of a good portfolio. With this in mind, I put together a list of projects to build that I think will demonstrate the full range of my skills… Copies of existing sites with unique modifications… Re-creations of old sites with my own perspective on how they should be built today… And, some original ideas. These are all high-quality, broadly scoped projects targeting real use cases. They are *not* quick one or two day jobs.
<p>About three weeks ago, I chose one from the list and started work. Now I’m at a critical stage. There are, of course, implementation challenges, but that was expected. The problem is that it’s not a new project any more. I’m fixing bugs more than I’m adding features and I’m caught under the avalanche of minutiae of making it <em>just right</em>. It has become a grind: <em>feature… bug… bug… bug… feature… bug… bug…</em> and so on. I’m tired. I don’t look forward to working on it any more. I find my mind wandering. I’m prone to distraction and doubt. Seemingly on it’s own, My mind is tempting me with alternatives… <em>Maybe I should work on my résumé instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should work on my blog instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should do some Upwork projects instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should read more about creating a portfolio first.</em> …</p>
<p><em>This</em> is a critical time. I know all too well that this happens in any project that takes more than a couple of days to finish.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my mental stamina is quite low. It’s my own fault, but at the same time I feel like it was completely out of my control.</p>
<p>For several years after I got out of the Army, I coasted. I did quite well for myself. I had no focus at all, but I had endless energy and boundless enthusiasm. Then I got sick. My energy disappeared and my enthusiasm turned to fear. My constant worry that I would trigger another <em>episode</em> taught me to <em>back off</em> whenever I felt stress. I got very good at <em>backing off</em> and lost the ability to <em>follow through</em>.</p>
<p>Then, my daughter started speaking and dreaming and wanting things beyond simple candy and toys. She has dreams and goals of her own now. What kind of example do I set if I stop working whenever my initial enthusiasm wears off. What kind of parent am I if I don’t earn an income to provide her with a decent education or an environment where her imagination can flourish and she can achieve her goals?</p>
<p>No! I will not <em>back off</em>! This is the mental equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_to_failure">muscle failure</a> and I must push in order to grow. This is an essential trial and I must not fail if I want to … be a person again.</p>
