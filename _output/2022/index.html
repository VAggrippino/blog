        <h2>AdSense: Rejected 😓</h2>
<p>I’ve been putting some effort into bringing my blog back to life. I’d like it to be a source of income, so I started looking into Google AdSense.</p>
<p>A few days later, I received an email telling me “Your site isn’t ready to show ads” because of a violation of Google’s Site Behavior policy regarding navigation:</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">> Examples of misguided navigation include, but are not limited to:
> 
> - False claims of downloadable or streaming content
> - Linking to content that does not exist
> - Redirecting users to irrelevant and/or misleading webpages
> - Text on a page unrelated to the topic and/or business model of the website.
</div>🤔… Okay, but this site definitely doesn’t have any of those things. It’s just me writing what’s on my mind. It does have some old articles that have external links, though. I’ve posted [a question](https://support.google.com/adsense/thread/181880337?hl=en) on the Google AdSense help forum. In the mean time, I’ll make sure there are no broken links. Since this is a WordPress site, I think I’ll give the [Broken Link Checker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/) plugin a try.
<h3>AdSense Help: Rejected</h3>
<p>Update, 2<sup>nd</sup> October 2022</p>
<p>After I went through every link in every article, my question on the Google AdSense Help forum was flagged as a duplicate, locked to prevent further discussion, and linked to <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/thread/176631357">Two of the most common reasons for site disapproval [AdSense Pro Post]</a>. I suppose the reason for rejection that was given by Google AdSense is meaningless and it’s all about content and traffic.</p>
<p>I thought AdSense might approve my site before I do the work to build an audience. After all, low traffic also means they don’t have to pay out. They’ve got a point, though. Without interesting content, the site might as well not exist… It’s time to write some interesting content.</p>

<p>When I was in the Army, I was a cross-country runner. I was pretty good at it. I’d get my second wind quickly and then I felt like I could actually run at a good pace forever. I considered running competitively and even started looking for marathons outside of the Army. But when my knee started hurting I stopped running. I didn’t realize that athletes consider pain to be an integral part of their sport. Hell, I never felt like a <em>real</em> athlete anyway. My knee <em>still</em> hurts all the time, but I often wonder what I missed.</p>
<p>Now, I’m a Web Developer. A <a href="https://www.aggrippino.com/one-armed-programming/">while ago</a>, I started to feel pain in my hand. It got bad and then, even after corrective surgery, it got much worse. So, I stopped working… stopped doing anything, really, just because my hand hurts… WTF!? Didn’t I already learn this lesson?!</p>
<p>I never anticipated the intense chronic pain, but that doesn’t matter. It’s a stupid excuse for neglecting my work and my hobby and most of what I do for fun. I can <em>still use</em> my hand and it’ll hurt no matter what I do. So… less Netflix, YouTube, and FMovies… More HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, etc…</p>
<p>I might not be as productive as I’d like, especially with the pain and impending <s>doom</s> spine surgery, but that’s no excuse to do nothing.</p>
<p>… To be continued…</p>
