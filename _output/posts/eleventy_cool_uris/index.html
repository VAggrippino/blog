  <h1>Eleventy's Cool URIs</h1>
<p><span class="subtitle">Why did Eleventy create a subdirectory?</span></p>
<p>While getting started with 11ty, I saw in the output folder that an <code>index.md</code>
file would become <code>index.html</code>, as expected, but <code>README.md</code> became
<code>README/index.html</code>. I didn't understand why there was a special case for the
README file.</p>
<p>It took me a minute, but I <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/#cool-uris-dont-change">found it</a>
with a reference to an article at the W3C stating (among other things) that cool
URIs don't have file extensions.</p>
<p>Okay. I get it. I would've expected something like that to be my job, not the
tool's, but it makes sense and I agree. But what do I do if I really want to
have a named output file. There's gotta be a way. Well, scroll down. The <code>permalink</code> <em>front matter</em> value allows me to specify the relative URL of the file that will be generated.</p>
