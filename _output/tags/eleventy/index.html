        <p>The permalink for all templates in a directory can be set in a template directory data file. This can be used along with data variables to generate the ideal URLs.</p>
<p>For example, if you have pages in a <code>posts</code> subdirectory, but you want those pages to be at the root of the generated site, you might use something like this:</p>
<p>File: <code>posts/posts.json</code></p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">"permalink"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"/.html"</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>

        <p>While getting started with 11ty, I saw in the output folder that an <code>index.md</code>
file would become <code>index.html</code>, as expected, but <code>README.md</code> became
<code>README/index.html</code>. I didn't understand why there was a special case for the
README file.</p>
<p>It took me a minute, but I <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/#cool-uris-dont-change">found it</a>
with a reference to an article at the W3C stating (among other things) that cool
URIs don't have file extensions.</p>
<p>Okay. I get it. I would've expected something like that to be my job, not the
tool's, but it makes sense and I agree. But what do I do if I really want to
have a named output file. There's gotta be a way. Well, scroll down. The <code>permalink</code> <em>front matter</em> value allows me to specify the relative URL of the file that will be generated.</p>
