<p>Today I spent some time coming up with <a href="https://codepen.io/VAggrippino/pen/BaZayxw">a possible solution</a> for another 100DaysOfCoder‚Äôs CSS problem‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if that counts towards my 100DaysOfCode effort or not.</p>
<p>Then I jumped back into the Modern React with Redux course. This is good for me. I enjoyed my brief detour into Vue, but I think I prefer the React ecosystem, community, and career opportunities.</p>
<p>Lessons 39 ‚Äì 48<br>
I learned more about reusable components and created a reusable component that could be used to contain a component I had already created.</p>
<p>I completed some exercises to demonstrate my understanding of basic props as well as <code>props.children</code> for nested content.</p>
<p>There was some discussion and comparison of class-based vs functional components. This course is taking the approach that it‚Äôll be easier to understand React hooks if we learn class based components and lifecycle methods first.</p>
<p>I also spent a little time figuring out <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a>. Apparently <code>create-react-app</code> assumes yarn is your preference if it‚Äôs installed. Even if you‚Äôve only installed it out of curiosity üòÖ</p>

Those buttons only share a link to the course itself. Nothing to show for my ‚Äúaccomplishment‚Äù.</figcaption></figure></div>I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm really impressed with the school. What they offered for this free weekend wasn‚Äôt much. If this is representative of their curriculum, it‚Äôs not worth paying for. There‚Äôs better stuff on YouTube.
