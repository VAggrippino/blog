        <h2>The Frustrating Flaw in Online Learning</h2>
<p>Online courses all seem to share one flawâ€¦ To put it bluntly, they piss me offâ€¦ Inconsistent information, outdated materials, poor explanation of key concepts, and, sometimes, patently incorrect information. But if I stop to think about it for a moment, itâ€™s actually a feature.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">Iâ€™ve taken advantage of **a lot** of online curriculum. Iâ€™ve been active at freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Udacity, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/vaggrippino), [Code School](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/vince-aggrippino), Coursera, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/vaggrippino/), and edX, just to name a few.
<p>I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve typed a long, angry tirade about inconsistencies or impossible questions only to delete the whole thing as soon as I calm down. (Well, a few might have been submitted ðŸ˜³)</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a problem, but itâ€™s really a feature. If we coast through a course from beginning to end without ever needing another site, it might result in a smoother experience, but we wouldnâ€™t learn much. It doesnâ€™t matter how good the course is. We <em>need</em> other perspectives or more detailed information from multiple sources. More importantly, we need to learn <em>how</em> to find information without a guide. And, especially in IT, we need to be very good at sorting out conflicting information and correcting errors in code and documentation. Without these supporting skills, the learned skill canâ€™t be effectively applied on the job.</p>
