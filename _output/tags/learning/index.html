        <h2>Easily Use Third-Party Images in WordPress?</h2>

  <figcaption>WordPress‚Äô Insert Image from URL</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let‚Äôs say, for example, I have a <em>photo</em> on Facebook that I want to use in a WordPress post. It‚Äôs <em>Public</em> so anyone with the URL can view it without even logging in. It‚Äôs not very difficult. Just get the image URL, add a new image block, and use the URL instead of uploading or selecting from the existing Media Library.</p>
<p>This seems to me like a common use case. It‚Äôs not just Facebook, either. There are countless popular websites that let people post their own images. Many of them are more focused on images than Facebook. It could be easier. It‚Äôd be great if there was an alternative <em>Facebook Image</em> block that I could add to my post. So, there must be a plugin for that, right? Well, maybe, but there are hundreds of Facebook plugins. Their descriptions mention galleries and feeds and posts, but none of them seem to succinctly say ‚ÄúUse Facebook photos in your posts.‚Äù So, let the trial and error begin.</p>

        <h2>The Frustrating Flaw in Online Learning</h2>
<p>Online courses all seem to share one flaw‚Ä¶ To put it bluntly, they piss me off‚Ä¶ Inconsistent information, outdated materials, poor explanation of key concepts, and, sometimes, patently incorrect information. But if I stop to think about it for a moment, it‚Äôs actually a feature.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">I‚Äôve taken advantage of **a lot** of online curriculum. I‚Äôve been active at freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Udacity, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/vaggrippino), [Code School](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/vince-aggrippino), Coursera, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/vaggrippino/), and edX, just to name a few.
<p>I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve typed a long, angry tirade about inconsistencies or impossible questions only to delete the whole thing as soon as I calm down. (Well, a few might have been submitted üò≥)</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a problem, but it‚Äôs really a feature. If we coast through a course from beginning to end without ever needing another site, it might result in a smoother experience, but we wouldn‚Äôt learn much. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good the course is. We <em>need</em> other perspectives or more detailed information from multiple sources. More importantly, we need to learn <em>how</em> to find information without a guide. And, especially in IT, we need to be very good at sorting out conflicting information and correcting errors in code and documentation. Without these supporting skills, the learned skill can‚Äôt be effectively applied on the job.</p>
