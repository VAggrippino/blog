        <h2>Losing Momentum</h2>
<p>I’m losing my momentum. That <em>new project</em> enthusiasm is gone and I’m faced with distraction and doubt. What do I do? Choose an easier alternative? Prepare more before continuing? Or push forward at a unique and considerable risk?</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">The greatest barrier to my employment right now is the lack of a good portfolio. With this in mind, I put together a list of projects to build that I think will demonstrate the full range of my skills… Copies of existing sites with unique modifications… Re-creations of old sites with my own perspective on how they should be built today… And, some original ideas. These are all high-quality, broadly scoped projects targeting real use cases. They are *not* quick one or two day jobs.
<p>About three weeks ago, I chose one from the list and started work. Now I’m at a critical stage. There are, of course, implementation challenges, but that was expected. The problem is that it’s not a new project any more. I’m fixing bugs more than I’m adding features and I’m caught under the avalanche of minutiae of making it <em>just right</em>. It has become a grind: <em>feature… bug… bug… bug… feature… bug… bug…</em> and so on. I’m tired. I don’t look forward to working on it any more. I find my mind wandering. I’m prone to distraction and doubt. Seemingly on it’s own, My mind is tempting me with alternatives… <em>Maybe I should work on my résumé instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should work on my blog instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should do some Upwork projects instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should read more about creating a portfolio first.</em> …</p>
<p><em>This</em> is a critical time. I know all too well that this happens in any project that takes more than a couple of days to finish.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my mental stamina is quite low. It’s my own fault, but at the same time I feel like it was completely out of my control.</p>
<p>For several years after I got out of the Army, I coasted. I did quite well for myself. I had no focus at all, but I had endless energy and boundless enthusiasm. Then I got sick. My energy disappeared and my enthusiasm turned to fear. My constant worry that I would trigger another <em>episode</em> taught me to <em>back off</em> whenever I felt stress. I got very good at <em>backing off</em> and lost the ability to <em>follow through</em>.</p>
<p>Then, my daughter started speaking and dreaming and wanting things beyond simple candy and toys. She has dreams and goals of her own now. What kind of example do I set if I stop working whenever my initial enthusiasm wears off. What kind of parent am I if I don’t earn an income to provide her with a decent education or an environment where her imagination can flourish and she can achieve her goals?</p>
<p>No! I will not <em>back off</em>! This is the mental equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_to_failure">muscle failure</a> and I must push in order to grow. This is an essential trial and I must not fail if I want to … be a person again.</p>

        <h2>Work / Life Imbalance</h2>
<p>You’re watching YouTube when you see a strange video entitled “No matter what, the work stays on!” …</p>
<p>The scene opens to a large set of balance scales resting on a low platform. A man puts a big shiny metal weight embossed with the word “work” on the left side of the scales. Next to it, he puts another weight. This one is marked “learning”.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">On the right side, he starts placing roughly formed gray cement bricks. One at a time, brick after brick, and the right side soon outweighs the left. He keeps going, and we see that each brick is engraved with a different word. The first one says "daughter". Then "wife"… More bricks… "house"… "diet"… As he continues, you notice that the condition of each brick is worse than the last. Only the first one, "daughter", appears to have been handled carefully. The rest are dirty and broken… "health"… "exercise"… The scale starts to overbalance and nearly falls over. You hear the man curse under his breath as he steps on the base of the scale to keep it from falling over… "pain"… and finally… "sleep".
<p>At first, the weights for &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;work&quot; seemed heavy, but now they look small by comparison to the stack of bricks. Somehow, though, he’s keeping everything in place. He seems satisfied with his work.</p>
<p>Just as he’s appraising his efforts, a large cinder block flies through the air and strikes the man in the back of the head! He falls forward, knocking over the scales along with all the bricks and the metal weights.</p>
<p>With blood oozing from a wound at the back of his head, you wonder if he’s dead, but he stirs. Disoriented and confused, he stands and looks at the cinder block with disgust. Then he proceeds to set up the scales again. First placing the metal weights, then each brick just as before. Finally, he picks up the cinder block and, placing both feet on the base of the scale, he carefully balances it on top of the other bricks. Now we can see what’s engraved in the side of the cinder block… &quot;mental health&quot;.</p>
<p>Our protagonist, sweating, bloody, and exhausted, glances up at the &quot;work&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; weights before looking directly at the camera and, flashing his best winning smile, gives a <em>thumbs up</em> before the scene fades to black.</p>
<p>&quot;That was weird.&quot; you say out loud before clicking <em>thumbs down</em>. Then you click on a &quot;related&quot; video about work / life balance from someone who quit their job to be a full-time <em>YouTuber</em>. &quot;He must know what he’s talking about.&quot; you think to yourself… &quot;He has over 100,000 subscribers!&quot;</p>
