        <h2>One-Armed Programming</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">![](https://i0.wp.com/www.aggrippino.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/one-armed-programming.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&ssl=1)<figcaption>Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits.</figcaption></figure>For years, I’ve been saying that *\*knock on wood\* …* I’ve never had any kind of <abbr title="Repetitive Strain Injury">RSI</abbr>. That’s no longer true. I have Cubital Tunnel Syndrome.
<p>Cubital Tunnel Syndrome affects the ring- and little- fingers and the severity can range from some slight tingling to extreme pain and near paralysis of these fingers. Unfortunately, I have the most severe symptoms and it got this bad in under 2 months.</p>
<p>This is a relatively common problem and the corrective surgery is scheduled. I thought it would be fine. I’d take some time off of work and be right back at it. Then I learned that full recovery takes up to 3 months. Screw that! I’d go insane (again)!</p>
<p>So, my next challenge begins now and is dedicated to becoming somewhat productive with only one arm.</p>
